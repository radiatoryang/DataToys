## Making it in America: The Immigrant Success Index
Immigrants hace been the engine of growth for the US since its founding as a nation. But that engine may be stalling after years of bitter debate over how to treat immigrants.
The Immigrant Success Index aims to add hard facts and aha's to the public debate about immigrants and immigration reform. Today's debate and media coverage frames ussues as 'us' versus 'them', as legal versus illegal, and as faceless people versus neighbors, friends and colleagues. The political climate is opening now for a richer discussion and we want to enrich the debate. We plan to do that by telling personal stories about immigrant life here and uncovering the cities where immigrants are more likely to succeed and what policies, services and factors help or hurt them.
